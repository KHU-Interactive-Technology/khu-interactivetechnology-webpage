Recently, our group publised two papers. 

Minha did interesting work on VR interaction techniques with 3D portals and publish this work at IEEE Access ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031442/) & [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BrOsh9toO8&feature=youtu.be)).

We also joined a collabrative research project with Prof. Seungwoo Je and Junyu at SUSTECH, China.
Extendlibur got accepted to UIST 2025. 
Extendlibur is a haptic retargeting for multiple users having different length virtual objects but the same physical stick, which is designed to deliver realistic haptic feedback from a single physical proxy to multiple virtual objects.
