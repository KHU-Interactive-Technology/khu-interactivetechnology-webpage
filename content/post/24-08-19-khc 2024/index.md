We presented both a Demonstration and a Poster at Korea Haptics Conference 2024.

Minwoo presented a Demonstration of a pneumatic haptic glove system for the learner, as well as a closed-loop position control approach based on monocular camera–based hand pose estimation to achieve instructor–learner hand synchronization.

Inhyuk presented a poster investigating locomotion techniques and vibration feedback to enhance the virtual reality experience in a lying-down position.

Thanks to Minwoo and Inhyuk for their hard work.
