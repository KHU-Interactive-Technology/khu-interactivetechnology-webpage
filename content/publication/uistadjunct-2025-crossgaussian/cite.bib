	abstract = {Remote users often face significant challenges in remote collaboration systems when joining virtual scenes reconstructed from a local user’s environment. They are disadvantaged by the information asymmetry inherent in a shared virtual environment compared to local users. We present CrossGaussian, a VR collaboration system designed to address these limitations by providing remote users with a comprehensive 3D interactive view of the shared environment, created using 3DGS. It blends 360° video streaming and a large-scale 3DGS reconstruction via our automated pipeline. We then define the design space for visualization and interaction techniques that combine wide-coverage 3D and responsive 360° scenes.},
